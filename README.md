# Cisco Packet Tracer Projects üåê

## Overview
This repository contains various projects and simulations created using Cisco Packet Tracer. Each project demonstrates different networking concepts and configurations, showcasing skills in network design, troubleshooting, and implementation.

## Projects

### Project 1: BasicLAN
- **Description:** The set up of a two basic LANs using a switch and three devices. It covers the concepts of connecting LANs together, configuring correct IP addresses, and connections.
- **Skills Learned:** 
  - Understanding of LAN configurations
  - IP addressing and subnetting

### Project 2: Static Routing
- **Description:** This project focuses on connecting several LANs together by configuring static routing. It includes setting correct IP addresses, default gateways, and static routes, along with configuring routers for proper communication between the networks.
- **Skills Learned:** 
  - Static routing configuration
  - IP addressing and subnetting
  - Understanding of router functionality and inter-LAN communication


### Project 3: Data Encapsulation & Analyization
- **Description:** This project explores the concepts of data encapsulation and packet analysis. It involves understanding how data is packaged at different OSI layers, analyzing the structure of packets, and using Cisco Packet Tracer to simulate and evaluate data transmission across a network.
- **Skills Learned:** 
  - Understanding data encapsulation processes
  - Analyzing packet structures (headers, trailers, etc.)
  - Network traffic analysis using simulation tools
  - Exploring various network protocols and their functions


### Project 4: Data Encapsulation & Analyization
- **Description:** This project focuses on VLAN concepts and VLAN trunking to improve network segmentation and efficiency. It involves creating and configuring VLANs on network devices, implementing VLAN trunking using IEEE 802.1Q protocol, and analyzing inter-VLAN communication using Cisco Packet Tracer. The project also explores how VLANs enhance network security and traffic management.
- **Skills Learned:** 
  - Understanding VLAN concepts and their role in network segmentation
  - Configuring VLANs and VLAN trunking on switches
  - Implementing and analyzing inter-VLAN routing
  - Using Cisco Packet Tracer for network simulation and troubleshooting
  - Exploring the IEEE 802.1Q trunking protocol

### **Project 5: Advanced LAN with SSH Access**  
- **Description**: Set up two LANs with VLANs, trunking, and secure SSH access. Configure network devices for remote management, routing, and VLAN communication.  
- **Skills Learned**:  
  - LAN setup and IP addressing  
  - Configuring VLANs, trunk links, and Layer 3 routing  
  - SSH access and security (SSH v2 only)  
  - Device security: password configuration, user authentication  
  - VLAN management and inter-VLAN communication
