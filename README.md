# Cisco Packet Tracer Projects

## Overview
This repository contains various projects and simulations created using Cisco Packet Tracer. Each project demonstrates different networking concepts and configurations, showcasing skills in network design, troubleshooting, and implementation.

## Projects

### Project 1: BasicLAN
- **Description:** The set up of a two basic LANs using a switch and three devices. It covers the concepts of connecting LANs together, configuring correct IP addresses, and connections.
- **Skills Learned:** 
  - Understanding of LAN configurations
  - IP addressing and subnetting


### Project 2: Static Routing
- **Description:** This project focuses on connecting several LANs together by configuring static routing. It includes setting correct IP addresses, default gateways, and static routes, along with configuring routers for proper communication between the networks.
- **Skills Learned:** 
  - Static routing configuration
  - IP addressing and subnetting
  - Understanding of router functionality and inter-LAN communication


### Project 3: Data Encapsulation & Analyization
- **Description:** This project explores the concepts of data encapsulation and packet analysis. It involves understanding how data is packaged at different OSI layers, analyzing the structure of packets, and using Cisco Packet Tracer to simulate and evaluate data transmission across a network.
- **Skills Learned:** 
  - Understanding data encapsulation processes
  - Analyzing packet structures (headers, trailers, etc.)
  - Network traffic analysis using simulation tools
  - Exploring various network protocols and their functions
